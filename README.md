# *College Course Plan, Certifications, and Job Resume*


## Description
**_Collection of Files to Show my Educational Development_** <br/>
This repository was created as a container of files that track and display my educational progress. My *college course plan* for the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse is a PDF file called: "UWL College Courses for Four-Year Plan.pdf". This course plan was originally created in Microsoft Excel, and contains my current academic track record. The course plan also contains a trajectory for the courses that I will need to take during the remainder of my time in college. 

The *certification files* that are also included in this repository were obtained from online learning platforms such as Udemy and Mosh. I chose to pursue educational opportunities that were outside of my regular college academic course work in order to further broaden my skill set. The certifications that I have earned thus far are stored in the repository as PDF files and include: "AgileFundamentals_CourseCertificate.pdf" and "certificate-of-completion-for-the-ultimate-git-course.pdf". I intend to earn more certifications in Computer Science in the future.

The last file included in this repository is my *current job resume file* for Computer Science. The resume file is a one-page PDF document that lists my current skills and knowledge of Computer Science. I am using the resume to obtain internships in the near future. The name of the resume file is: "Resume-Version2.pdf".
